== Hackday Projects

This is a simple Ruby on Rails app to help document and share projects made on a Hack Day. It is being quickly written the week before my Hack Day "Rewired State: National Hack The Government Day".

== Features

* Simple and clean: Minimum server set up and code
* * All authentication handled by OpenID
* * Photos added via flickr tags, pulled on client side through JSONP (No background process, caching etc.)
* * Pull code commits from github
* * Hopefully support SVN somehow

== Contributions

* Please do feel free to fork and contribute. Just make sure you keep everything simple.
