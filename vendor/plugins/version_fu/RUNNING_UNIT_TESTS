This plugin should be inside a Rails project in the vendor/plugins/version_fu folder.

The project should also have Rails froze in vendor/rails

You'll probably want to test with sqlite3, so make sure you have the sqlite3-ruby gem installed

Inside the vendor/plugins/version_fu directory, run the test suite with:
  $ ruby test/version_fu_test.rb
